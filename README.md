# Robotic_Arm
A project deticated to making a robotic arm from the parts of a 3d printer
The documentation of the arm will be taking place in a engineering notebook for the time being, it will eventually be transferred over to online documentation
  in the form of a wiki. Pictures of the engineering notebook however will be updated as new pages are completed and will be titled as they are in the notebook. 
Colaboration and contributions to this project are more than welcome and for the time being they have no structure on how those contributions must be given.
  All that is asked is that you do your due diligence.
